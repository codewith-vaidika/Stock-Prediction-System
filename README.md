#  Stock Price Prediction Model

A **Machine Learning project (2024 – Present)** that predicts stock prices using **time-series data**. The project implements **LSTM networks** for sequential prediction, **XGBoost** for regression-based forecasting, and a custom **Ensemble model (XGBoost + LSTM)** to combine the strengths of both approaches.

---

##  Features

*  **Data Preprocessing** using Pandas & NumPy
*  **Visualization** with Matplotlib for trend analysis
*  **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** for sequential time-series prediction
*  **XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)** for regression-based forecasting
*  **Ensemble Model** (LSTM + XGBoost) for improved accuracy
*  Modular, extensible Python code

---

##  Tech Stack

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries & Tools:**

  * `scikit-learn` – Preprocessing, evaluation
  * `xgboost` – Gradient boosting regression
  * `tensorflow / keras` – LSTM implementation
  * `pandas`, `numpy` – Data handling
  * `matplotlib` – Visualization

---

##  Models Implemented

1. **LSTM Model** – Captures sequential dependencies in stock prices.
2. **XGBoost Model** – Learns regression patterns efficiently.
3. **Ensemble Model** – Combines LSTM & XGBoost predictions (ensemble learning).
